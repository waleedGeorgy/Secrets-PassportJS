# Secrets 
A basic website that is loosely based off the Whisper app, where users can anonemously post their secrets.<br />
The main point of this project is to test out and experiment with the <b>PassportJS</b> package, that is not very well documented, and does not have much resources or tutorials online, especially when used with PostgreSQL.<br />
